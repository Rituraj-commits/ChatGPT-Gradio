ChatGPT-Gradio is a project that uses the OpenAI API and Gradio library to generate responses for user input using a large language model called GPT-3.5. This project is useful for developing chatbots, text generators, and other natural language processing applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API Key
- Gradio library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```https://github.com/Rituraj-commits/ChatGPT-Gradio.git```

2. Install the required packages using pip:
   
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Add your OpenAi API key to the config.py file:
   
```OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'```

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:
```python model.py```
This will start a Gradio interface where you can input text and get a response generated by the GPT-3.5 model.
